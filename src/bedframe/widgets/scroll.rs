//! Scroll physics: one model behind every scroll surface.
//!
//! BedFrame opens scroll viewports two ways — [`Ui::scroll_begin`] for an
//! explicit viewport and a layout container with `overflow: scroll` for the
//! view layer — and both run the wheel, keyboard, scrollbar, momentum and
//! programmatic routing implemented here, so a scroll feels identical
//! wherever it is built.
//!
//! The model mirrors the parts of the DOM scrolling surface applications
//! actually use, and defaults to how a modern web page feels:
//!
//! - Wheel notches glide toward a destination instead of jumping, and
//!   repeated notches accumulate into one gesture. Precision devices
//!   (trackpads) apply their pixels 1:1 — they already produce smooth,
//!   inertial deltas — and only coast when such a gesture stops mid-flight.
//! - [`Ui::scroll_to`], [`Ui::scroll_by`] and [`Ui::scroll_into_view`]
//!   take a [`ScrollBehavior`] (`Instant`, `Smooth`, `Auto`) and
//!   [`ScrollAlign`] targeting, like `element.scrollTo({top, behavior})`
//!   and `element.scrollIntoView({block, behavior})`.
//! - Nested views chain: what the inner view cannot use (it is at its end)
//!   continues the enclosing one, the way `overscroll-behavior: auto`
//!   passes a wheel on to the page.
//! - A view under the pointer scrolls from the keyboard (arrows, page
//!   keys, Home/End) while no widget owns focus.
//!
//! Every knob lives on [`ScrollConfig`] (`Ui::scroll_config`) and
//! [`ScrollConfig::no_momentum`] restores the old jump-and-stop feel:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! // A snappier glide, no keyboard scrolling, and a longer wheel notch.
//! ui.scroll_config = ScrollConfig {
//!     smoothness: 0.04,
//!     keyboard: false,
//!     line_height: 56.0,
//!     ..ScrollConfig::default()
//! };
//! ```
