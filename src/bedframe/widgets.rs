//! Immediate-mode widgets with persistent, animated state.
//!
//! [`Ui`] owns the fonts, glyph atlas and draw list for one frame. Widgets
//! take a stable id (hashed from a scope stack plus a label), keep their
//! interaction state in [`Ui`] across frames, and animate it (hover fades,
//! knob travel) with [`crate::ui::tween`] — so menus and HUDs move without
//! per-widget code.
//!
//! Everything a widget draws, you can draw directly through
//! [`Ui::draw_list_mut`] — widgets are convenience, not a cage.
